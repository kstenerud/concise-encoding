Release Process
===============

TODO: Update new_release.sh to grab the correct tag.


Major releases will contain only the major version number.

Fixes will use major.minor versioning, and MUST NOT contain breaking changes.


Steps:

1. Tag repo
2. Update release-list-index.md
3. Run `publish_release.sh <release version>`
4. Verify and check in result
